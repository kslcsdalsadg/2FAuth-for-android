# PURPOSE

The purpose of this app is to facilitate access to 2FA tokens managed through <A HREF="https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth">Bubka's 2FAuth service</A>.

To do this, we have developed an Android App that reads 2FA accounts from a user server and stores them locally, allowing the generation of 2FA codes even when we are not connected to the server.

# MAIN FEATURES

Read the 2FA accounts for a user (identified by the server URL location and an access token) and generate OTP tokens offline.

Protection level: PIN password and fingerprint access.

# OPEN SOURCE LIBRARIES WE USE

We generate the OTP codes using the JAVA library from <A HREF="https://github.com/BastiaanJansen/otp-java">Bastiaan Jansen</A>.
